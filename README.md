# Overview
QEats is a popular food ordering app that allows users to browse and order their favorite dishes from nearby restaurants.

During the course of this project,
- I had build different parts of the QEats backend which is a Spring Boot application.
- Several REST API endpoints were implemented to query restaurant information and place food orders.
- To give a sense of real-world problems, production issues were investigated using Scientific Debugging methods.
- Along with this, I improved the app performance under large load scenarios as well as included an advanced search feature in the app. 

# Retrieve restaurant data for a given user location
### Scope of Work
- Implemented GET /API/v1/restaurants and the corresponding request handler and response methods.
- Used Mockito to enable the development of the relevant MVCS layers independently.
- Retrieved a list of restaurants from MongoDB based on a user location.
### Skills used
*Spring Boot, Spring Data, REST API, Jackson, Mockito, JUnit, MongoDB*
